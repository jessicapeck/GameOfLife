## Introduction
Welcome to Conway's Game of Life! This was one of the first projects I developed in C#, I used this project to practice C# and become more familiar with using Visual Studio WinForms.

The version of Conway's Game of Life that I have created uses a hard border which means that the grid has fixed boundaries and does not wrap around. This border is shown as a pink line.

## Credits
I watched the YouTube video [Coding Challenge #85: The Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg) by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) to help me understand the logic used in the Game of Life.

To find out more about the patterns that can be created in Conway's Game of Life, there is more information of the [Conway's Game of Life Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
