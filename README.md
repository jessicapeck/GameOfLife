## Introduction
Welcome to Conway's Game of Life! This was one of the first projects I developed in C#, I used this project to practice C# and become more familiar with using Visual Studio WinForms.

The version of Conway's Game of Life that I have written uses a hard border which means that the grid has fixed boundaries and does not wrap around. This border is shown as a pink line.

## How to use
You can manually change the number of rows and columns that are used within the grid within the program code:

As an evaluation of this project, if I were to develop it again, I would include a feature to allow the user to change the number of rows and columns on the form (within the running program window) as opposed to having to hard-code it.

The window is resizable, so the ratio of the grid can be changed.

## Credits
I watched the YouTube video [Coding Challenge #85: The Game of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg) by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) to help me understand the logic used in the Game of Life.

To find out more about the patterns that can be created in Conway's Game of Life, there is more information of the [Conway's Game of Life Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
